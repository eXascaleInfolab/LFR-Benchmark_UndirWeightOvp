# LFR-Benchmark_UndirWeightOvp
Extended version of the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi Benchmark for Undirected Weighted Overlapping networks to evaluate clustering algorithms

## Description
This program is an implementation of the algorithm described in the paper "Directed, weighted and overlapping benchmark graphs for community detection algorithms", written by Andrea Lancichinetti and Santo Fortunato. In particular, this program is to produce undirected weighted networks with overlapping nodes.  
Each feedback is very welcome. If you have found a bug or have problems, or want to give advises, please contact us:

## Compilation

In order to compile, type: `$ make`.  
This command builds the binary named `TAG=lfrbench_udwo` as specified in the `./makefile`. In the following description, the application (`lfrbench_udwo`) is referred to as `benchmark` for convenience.

## Usage

To run the program, type:  
```
./benchmark [FLAG] [P]

To set the parameters, type:
-N		[number of nodes]
-k		[average degree]
-maxk		[maximum degree]
-mut		[mixing parameter for the topology]
-muw		[mixing parameter for the weights]
-beta		[exponent for the weight distribution]
-t1		[minus exponent for the degree sequence]
-t2		[minus exponent for the community size distribution]
-minc		[minimum for the community sizes]
-maxc		[maximum for the community sizes]
-on		[number of overlapping nodes]
-om		[number of memberships of the overlapping nodes]
-C		[Average clustering coefficient]
-cnl		[output communities as strings of nodes (input format for NMI evaluation)]
-name		[base name for the output files]. It is used for the network, communities and statistics; files extensions are added automatically:
	.nsa  - network, represented by space/tab separated arcs
	.nse  - network, represented by space/tab separated edges
	{.cnl, .nmc}  - communities, represented by nodes lists '.cnl' if '-cnl' is used, otherwise as a nodes membership in communities '.nmc')
	.nst  - network statistics
-seed		[file name of the random seed, default: seed.txt]
-a		[{0, 1} yield directed network (1 - arcs) rather than undirected (0 - edges), default: 0 - edges]
```

In this program you can assign the number of overlapping nodes (option -on) and assign the number of memberships for them (option `-om`). The other nodes will have only one membership. For instance, typing
```
./benchmark [flags...] -N 1000 -on 20 -om 2
```
will produce a network with 1000 nodes, 980 with only one membership and 20 nodes with two memberships.

It is also possible to set the parameters writing flags and relative numbers in a file (look at flags.dat to see an example). To specify the file, use the option: `-f	[filename]`

You can set the parameters both writing some of them in the file, and using flags from the command line for others (if you set a parameter twice, the latter one will be taken).

`-N, -k, -maxk, -muw` have to be specified. For the others, the program can use default values: `t1=2, 	t2=1, 	on=0,	om=0,	beta=1.5, mut=muw, minc` and `maxc` will be chosen close to the degree sequence extremes.  

The flag `-C` is not mandatory. If you use it, the program will perform a number of rewiring steps to increase the average cluster coefficient up to the wished value.
Since other constraints must be fulfilled, if the wished value will not be reached after a certain time, the program will stop (displaying a warning).

### Random Seed

In the specified seed file (default is seed.txt) you can edit the seed which generates the random numbers. After reading, the program will increase this number by 1 (this is done to generate different networks running the program again and again). If the file is erased, it will be produced by the program again.

### Accessory Options

To have a random network use: `-rand`  
Using this option will set `mut=0`, `muw=0` and `minc=maxc=N`, i.e. there will be only one community.

Use option: `-sup (-inf)`

if you want to produce a benchmark whose distribution of the ratio of external degree/total degree is superiorly (inferiorly) bounded by the mixing parameter (only for the topology). In other words, if you use one of these options, the mixing parameter is not the average ratio of external degree/total degree (as it used to be) but the maximum (or the minimum) of that distribution. When using one of these options, what the program essentially does is to approximate the external degree always by excess (or by defect) and if necessary to modify the degree distribution. Nevertheless, this last possibility occurs for a few nodes and numerical simulations show that it does not affect the degree distribution appreciably.


## Examples
Example1:  `./benchmark -N 1000 -k 15 -maxk 50 -muw 0.1 -minc 20 -maxc 50`  
Example2:  `./benchmark -f flags.dat -t1 3`

If you want to produce a kind of Girvan-Newman benchmark, you can type:  
`./benchmark -N 128 -k 16 -maxk 16 -muw 0.1 -minc 32 -maxc 32 -beta 1`

## Output
Please note that the community size distribution can be modified by the program to satisfy several constraints (a warning will be displayed).

The program will produce three files:

1. Network file `Network.<nsl>` contains the list of edges (nodes are labelled from 1 to the number of nodes; the edges are ordered and repeated twice for `nsa` format and unordered (not repeated) for the `nse` format, i.e. source-target and target-source), with the relative weight. The [NSL format](https://github.com/eXascaleInfolab/PyCABeM/blob/master/formats/format.nsl), the network specified by <links> (arcs / edges), is a generalization of the .snap, .ncol and Edge/Arcs Graph formats.
1. Community file `Network.nmc` contains a list of the nodes and their membership (memberships are labeled by integer numbers >=1).
1. Statistics file `Network.nst` contains the degree distribution (in logarithmic bins), the community size distribution, the distribution of the mixing parameter for the topology and the weights, and the internal and external weight distribution.

- Rodrigo Rocha Gomes e Souza, for reporting bugs (and also fixing them)
- Filippo Radicchi and Jos Ramasco for testing the program

## Changelog
Additionally implemented features on top of the original LFR Benchmark are the following:
- Parameter `-a` added to specify directed (arcs) / undirected (edges) output network
- Parameter `-seed` added for the custom seed filename
- Parameter `-cnl` ([community nodes list](https://github.com/eXascaleInfolab/PyCABeM/blob/master/formats/format.cnl)) added to output communities (clusters) as lists of
nodes to be compatible with NMI evaluation input format (.cnl)
- Parameter `-name` added to give custom name for the output files
- `maxk` is automatically decreased if required for the network generation with the specified `k`
(instead of the generation process termination)
